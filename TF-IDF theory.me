TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) analysis is a statistical method used to evaluate the relevance of a word to a document in a collection of documents. It combines term frequency (TF) with inverse document frequency (IDF) to determine a word's importance. 
Key Concepts:
- Term Frequency (TF): Measures how often a word appears in a single document. 
- Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Measures how rare a word is across the entire corpus (collection of documents). 
- TF-IDF Score: Calculated by multiplying TF and IDF. Higher scores indicate more important words in a document relative to the corpus.
